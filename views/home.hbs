        <h1 class="p-name">Why are Sports Important for kids?</h1>
        <p>Growing up my parents pushed me to play as many sports as possible, so I practically played every sport here and there which Iâ€™m forever grateful for. I think being apart of team sports is absolutely necessary for young kids in order to develop strong communication, team work, selflessness, and coordination skills that will benefit kids forever.
